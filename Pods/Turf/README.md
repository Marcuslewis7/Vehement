A [spatial analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_analysis) library written in Swift for native iOS and macOS applications, ported from [Turf.js](https://github.com/Turfjs/turf/).

### Installation

Although there has not yet been a beta release of this library yet, you can still experiment with it in your application by using CocoaPods to install it. Edit your Podfile to include:

```
pod 'Turf-swift', '~> 0.0.4'
```

Alternatively, you can clone this repo and drag and drop Turf.swift and CoreLocation.swift into your project in Xcode.
